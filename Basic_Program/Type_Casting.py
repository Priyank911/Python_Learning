#TypeCasting = Convert one datatype to another datatype
x = 1
y = 2.0
z = "3"

y = int(y) # method 1
print(int(y)) # method 2
print(type(y)) # here we check the type of method

#z = int(z)
print(z*3) # Check the output after and before the above code

#Noted:- TypeError -->(String are only concatenate with String)
